# nova::stream

Very simple C++ single-include-file library which helps to write C++ input/output streams easily.

__nova::stream__ is similar to [boost::iostreams](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/libs/iostreams/doc/index.html).
If you're wondering why I had to write my own streams library rather than
using excellent __boost::iostreams__ I answer it in
["Why new stream library"](https://github.com/novalexei/nstream/wiki/Why-new-stream-library)

__nova::stream__ also has an exceptional [performance](https://github.com/novalexei/nstream/wiki/nstream-Performance)
